Dynamic joystick
Touch Begin
	Get initial position
while moving/stationary
	get position
	calculate angle from initial position
	Calculate velocity? distance with a cap at 1
		set radius of hard limit, normalize from origin to this radius
	set touch indicator position at touch position && limit
		(derive this from the movement result?)
on end/cancel
	destroy joystick object?
	maintain velocity (physics based movement)


Static JoyStick
	Origin in bottom left corner
Touch begin
	get position
	if position is within radius
		while moving/stationary
			calculate angle from origin
			calculate distance from origin (capped at radius)
			place touch indicator at touch positin (capped at radius)
touch end
	hide touch indicator (lerp back to zero?)
	set movement to zero	



Static joystick (different approach)
	create radius with collision
		create touch circle inside that radius
		let the player drag the inner touch circle	
		calculate movement based on position of the inner circle asset?

Move to touch position

touch begin
	get touch position
	
	while moving/stationary
		on frame()
		calculate angle between touch and player
		constant speed?
		rotate and move player based on angle 
	on touch end
		stop moving character
